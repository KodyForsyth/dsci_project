    "# REPORT: Predicting Risk of Heart Disease from Accessible Health Metrics\n",
    "_Created by : Tyler Ofreneo, Arthur Zhang, Kody Forsyth, Natalia Blanco_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, heart disease is the second leading cause of death in Canada, with approximately 1 in 12 Canadian adults over 20 living with a diagnosis. These metrics highlight the importance of knowing the risk factors and having access to medical advice. However, a shortage of physicians in Canada is causing a lack of available health care (Flood et al., 2023). Non-healthcare professionals do not have the means to properly self-evaluate symptoms, therefore our project seeks to help the general population to make informative decisions about heart disease symptoms that are self-monitored or easily accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we ask, <b>is it possible to classify individuals into levels of heart disease risk (low risk, moderate risk, or high risk) based on blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate and chest pain?<b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis will use the Heart Disease dataset from the Cleveland database for heart disease (Andras et al., 1988). This database consists of 303 patients without history of heart disease, who were admitted to the Cleveland Clinic between 1981 and 1984. \n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "This K-nearest neighbours classification analysis of a heart disease dataset allowed us to demonstrate a link between certain health metrics of blood pressure, cholesterol and heart rate to the diagnosis of heart disease. The classifier created in this report demonstrated a high overall accuracy of 90% and performed well in identifying high-risk cases, with slightly lower performance in predicting low-risk and moderate-risk heart disease (Figure 6, 7). An evaluation of the analysis using a confusion matrix (table 5) indicated a high degree of precision and recall across different risk categories. The results emphasized the model’s strength in identifying high-risk cases with a precision of 93% and a recall of 100%. Low-risk and moderate-risk heart disease measured at 98% and 82% precision coupled with 73% and 96% recall respectively. The trade-off in recall measurements for moderate- and low-risk heart disease diagnosis indicates the model has slightly less sensitivity for predicting instances of these diagnoses. However, it is important to highlight that the model excels in identifying high-risk heart disease, which is particularly significant because of the severity of this category. A high-degree of performance for this risk level is crucial for early treatment and better outcomes for critical cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on several previous research studies, our team expected a strong relationship between heart disease diagnosis and blood pressure, cholesterol and heart rate symptoms (Fuchs et al., 2020; Hjalmarson et al., 2007; Arnold et al., 2008). In particular, the literature indicated correlations between higher-risk heart disease diagnosis and high blood pressure, high cholesterol serum, and increased heart rate. Our expectations aligned with the effectiveness demonstrated by the model in predicting diagnoses based on these symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis successfully developed a K-nearest neighbours classification model designed to diagnose heart disease. The model uses readily available health metrics accessible to individuals in Canada, enabling self-monitoring of blood pressure, cholesterol and heart rate symptoms for detection of heart disease risk levels. By designing a model for recognizing heart disease risk using common symptoms, this algorithm can provide individuals more context for the severity of their symptoms that require urgent health care consultations. Furthermore, this project will allow future studies to question whether genetic, environmental or demographics can refine these predictions.\n"
