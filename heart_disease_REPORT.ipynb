    "# REPORT: Predicting Risk of Heart Disease from Accessible Health Metrics\n",
    "_Created by : Tyler Ofreneo, Arthur Zhang, Kody Forsyth, Natalia Blanco_\n",

    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, heart disease is the second leading cause of death in Canada, with approximately 1 in 12 Canadian adults over 20 living with a diagnosis. These metrics highlight the importance of knowing the risk factors and having access to medical advice. However, a shortage of physicians in Canada is causing a lack of available health care (Flood et al., 2023). Non-healthcare professionals do not have the means to properly self-evaluate symptoms, therefore our project seeks to help the general population to make informative decisions about heart disease symptoms that are self-monitored or easily accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we ask, <b>is it possible to classify individuals into levels of heart disease risk (low risk, moderate risk, or high risk) based on blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate and chest pain?<b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis will use the Heart Disease dataset from the Cleveland database for heart disease (Andras et al., 1988). This database consists of 303 patients without history of heart disease, who were admitted to the Cleveland Clinic between 1981 and 1984. \n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "This classification analysis suggested that there is a link between the specific health metrics of blood pressure, cholesterol and heart rate to the diagnosis of heart disease. An evaluation of the model created in this analysis showed a high accuracy which provides confidence in the predictions of the classifier. High levels of precision and recall for each class of heart disease diagnosis indicate robust performance in correctly identifying diagnosis. Notably, the highest calculated precision and recall were provided for the high-risk heart disease class, which is highly beneficial for the utility of this model due to the severity of this particular diagnosis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on several previous research studies, our team expected a strong relationship between heart disease diagnosis and blood pressure, cholesterol and heart rate symptoms (Fuchs et al., 2020; Hjalmarson et al., 2007; Arnold et al., 2008). Our expectations aligned well with the effectiveness demonstrated by the K Neighbors Classification model in predicting diagnoses based on these symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of this project may help inform the general population of their susceptibility to heart disease based on self-monitored health metrics or symptoms. By designing a model for recognizing heart disease risk using common symptoms, we have provided context for the severity of symptoms that require urgent health care consultations. Furthermore, this project will allow future studies to question whether genetic, environmental or demographics can refine these predictions."
