    "# REPORT: Predicting Risk of Heart Disease from Accessible Health Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, heart disease is the second leading cause of death in Canada, with approximately 1 in 12 Canadian adults over 20 living with a diagnosis. These metrics highlight the importance of knowing the risk factors and having access to medical advice. However, a shortage of physicians in Canada is causing a lack of available health care (Flood et al., 2023). Non-healthcare professionals do not have the means to properly self-evaluate symptoms, therefore our project seeks to help the general population to make informative decisions about heart disease symptoms that are self-monitored or easily accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we ask, is it possible to classify individuals into levels of heart disease risk (low risk, moderate risk, or high risk) based on blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate and chest pain?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis will use the Heart Disease dataset from the Cleveland database for heart disease (Andras et al., 1988). This database consists of 303 patients without history of heart disease, who were admitted to the Cleveland Clinic between 1981 and 1984. \n",
